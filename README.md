Part 4 (Tickets and Ticket Lifecycle)

Practice creating, triaging, and solving tickets. For guidance on handling multiple tickets, consider watching instructional videos. Here are some ticket examples:



Sev-A (1 hour, 24/7) [entire mobile/online banking system is down] -> Assign to SysAdmins.
Sev-B (4 hours, 24/7) [accounting department needs Adobe upgrade, broken].
Sev-B/C (2 hours, business hours) [CFOâ€™s laptop seems a bit slow].
